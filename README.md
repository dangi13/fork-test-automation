This is just a basic framework under development for automating Web applications and APIs.

Designed specifically for **fork** project.

This is a multi module maven project.
You will find the instructions on how to run the tests inside the README of each module.

I also created github workflows in case you want to run them directly on github and do not want to clone and run on local machine.   
**Workflow for UI automation** : Fork UI Automation   
**Workflow for API automation** : Fork API Automation   

Steps are inside each module on how to trigger them and see results.
