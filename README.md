This is just a basic framework under development for automating Web applications and APIs.

Designed specifically for `fork` project.

This is a multi module maven project.
You will find the instructions on how to run the tests inside the README of each module.

I also created github workflows in case you want to run them directly on github and do not want to clone and run on local machine (Yes I can understand that we can be lazy :bear: in setting up projects locally ).   
1. Workflow for UI automation : `Fork UI Automation`  
1. Workflow for API automation : `Fork API Automation`   

Steps are inside each module on how to trigger them and see results.

Hope you will like it  :shipit:
